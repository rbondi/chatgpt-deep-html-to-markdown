							Aleksandar Vučić’s Serbia: The Best Since Tito?
						</h1>
						<p data-start="52" data-end="1440">
							In the winter of 2023, Aleksandar Vučić stood before a jubilant crowd in Novi Beograd, inaugurating a new highway and invoking a name sacrosanct in Serbian memory. With characteristic bravado, he declared that in just 11 years, his government had built <strong data-start="305" data-end="335">335 kilometers of highways</strong> – more than were constructed under Josip Broz Tito, Slobodan Milošević, and the post-2000 democratic governments combined<span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://www.alo.rs/vesti/politika/713696/vucic-za-11-godina-izgradeno-vise-od-335-km-sada-se-gradi-vise-od-500/vest#:~:text=Predsednik%20Srbije%20Aleksandar%20Vu%C4%8Di%C4%87%20izjavio,radi%20vi%C5%A1e%20od%20500%20kilometara" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">alo.rs</span></span></span></a></span>. The crowd cheered as Vučić rattled off figures, casting himself as a leader who delivers concrete results where predecessors fell short. Such scenes have become commonplace in Serbia over the past decade: Vučić cutting ribbons on factories and roads, touting economic growth and stability, all while consciously <strong data-start="808" data-end="845">drawing comparisons to Tito’s era</strong> – a time many recall as one of national dignity and relative prosperity. For a nation long in the shadow of Tito’s legacy, the suggestion that <em data-start="989" data-end="995">this</em> government might be “the best since Tito” lands as both bold flattery and a serious question. Has Vučić’s regime since 2014 truly outshone all others in post-Tito Serbia? And at what cost? To answer this requires examining not only <strong data-start="1228" data-end="1282">domestic governance and foreign policy under Vučić</strong>, but also the nature of his rule – described by critics as <em data-start="1342" data-end="1372">competitive authoritarianism</em> – and weighing its tangible gains against its democratic deficits.

							Echoes of Tito in a Fractured Legacy
						</h2>
						<p data-start="1484" data-end="2949">
							For many Serbians, Tito’s Yugoslavia stands as a golden benchmark. Though a communist one-party state, Tito’s rule (1945–1980) delivered decades of stability, international prestige through non-alignment, and a standard of living remembered fondly by older generations. No post-Tito leader has fully escaped his shadow. After Tito’s death, Serbia’s journey veered through trauma: the breakup of Yugoslavia, wars and sanctions in the 1990s under <strong data-start="1929" data-end="1951">Slobodan Milošević</strong>, a fleeting democratic blossoming after 2000 marred by economic pain and the assassination of reformist Prime Minister <strong data-start="2071" data-end="2087">Zoran Đinđić</strong> in 2003, and a period of pro-Western leadership under President <strong data-start="2152" data-end="2167">Boris Tadić</strong> that ended amidst stagnation and frustration by 2012. Each era left a complicated legacy. Milošević’s nationalist regime brought international pariah status and economic collapse; the pro-democracy governments of the 2000s restored basic freedoms and steered Serbia toward Europe, but they struggled to deliver broad prosperity or uproot corruption. By the time <strong data-start="2530" data-end="2550">Aleksandar Vučić</strong> emerged as the dominant figure – first as a powerful deputy PM in 2012, then Prime Minister in 2014, and President since 2017 – many citizens were yearning for <strong data-start="2711" data-end="2771">strong leadership that could ensure stability and growth</strong>. Vučić, a shrewd political chameleon who had reinvented himself from an ultranationalist into a self-styled reformer, seized this yearning and wrapped himself in Tito’s mantle.
						</p>
						<p data-start="2951" data-end="4356">
							It’s no accident that Vučić <strong data-start="2979" data-end="3019">consciously taps into Tito nostalgia</strong>. As early as 2014, after a year in power, Vučić boasted that under his rule Serbia had “regained the good reputation it had in Tito’s time”<span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/balkan-exhume-yugoslav-leader-josip-tito-aleksandar-vucic-serbia/#:~:text=Balkan%20plot%20to%20dig%20up,and%20that%20he%20is" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">politico.eu</span></span></span></a></span>.

The <strong data-start="3349" data-end="3406">public, for its part, has played into these parallels</strong>. In a 2016 opinion survey by the Demostat research center, 32% of Serbians named Tito the country’s greatest leader – but Vučić was right on his heels at 31%, far ahead of any other post-Tito figure<span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://www.danas.rs/vesti/politika/vucic-odmah-iza-tita-djindjic-ispred-milosevica/#:~:text=Kad%20dobiju%20%C5%A1est%20ponu%C4%91enih%20imena,tik%20iza%20njega%20Aleksandar%20Vu%C4%8Di%C4%87" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">danas.rs</span></span></span></a></span>.

In other words, a significant share of the population already felt by 2016 that <strong data-start="3861" data-end="3901">Vučić was the best leader since Tito</strong>, effectively tying the Yugoslav legend in popular esteem. And his star has only risen since. One 2021 poll found Vučić’s approval and trust ratings soaring above 60%, even <strong data-start="4074" data-end="4125">surpassing Tito’s popularity (50%) in hindsight</strong><span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://en.interaffairs.ru/article/vucic-in-serbia-more-popular-than-tito/#:~:text=A%20sociological%20survey%20which%20was,and%20Slobodan%20Milosevic%20%2836" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">en.interaffairs.ru</span></span></span></a></span>. Such numbers reflect a genuine strand of Serbian public opinion: after decades of disillusionment, many see in Vučić a leader who, like Tito, can keep the country stable and respected abroad.
						</p>
						<p data-start="4358" data-end="5735">
							Why this sentiment? Part of the answer lies in <strong data-start="4405" data-end="4453">what Vučić’s regime has delivered materially</strong>, and part in who he is compared to. For those who lived through the 1990s, Vučić’s time in power looks almost tranquilly prosperous. Under Milošević, Serbia suffered hyperinflation, isolation, and military defeat; by contrast, Vučić’s Serbia has had no wars and managed steady if unspectacular economic growth (averaging around 3% annually)<span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://www.focus-economics.com/country-indicator/serbia/gdp/#:~:text=In%20the%20year%202024%2C%20the,information%2C%20visit%20our%20dedicated%20page" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">focus-economics.com</span></span></span></a></span>. The chaotic 1990s and the <strong data-start="4859" data-end="4894">painful transition of the 2000s</strong> created a craving for normalcy and order. Vučić’s government often points to <strong data-start="4972" data-end="4999">infrastructure projects</strong> as symbols of national progress: new highways, renovated rails, gleaming bridges. In early 2023, responding to a journalist’s skepticism, Vučić eagerly <strong data-start="5152" data-end="5179">did the math on live TV</strong> – by official records, around 687 km of highways existed in Serbia in 2011 (including some still under construction), whereas since 2012 another 335 km have been completed and over 500 km are in progress<span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://www.alo.rs/vesti/politika/713696/vucic-za-11-godina-izgradeno-vise-od-335-km-sada-se-gradi-vise-od-500/vest#:~:text=Isti%C4%8De%20da%20je%20on%20rekao,da%20se%20stigne%20ta%20kilometra%C5%BEa" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">alo.rs</span></span></span></a></span><span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://www.alo.rs/vesti/politika/713696/vucic-za-11-godina-izgradeno-vise-od-335-km-sada-se-gradi-vise-od-500/vest#:~:text=Predsednik%20Srbije%20Aleksandar%20Vu%C4%8Di%C4%87%20izjavio,radi%20vi%C5%A1e%20od%20500%20kilometara" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">alo.rs</span></span></span></a></span>. “How have we built more than Tito, Milošević and [the] DOS [post-2000] governments?

						</p>
						<p data-start="5737" data-end="7142">
							Economic headlines bolster this narrative. Serbia’s once chronically high unemployment (over 20% a decade ago) has fallen into single digits. Foreign direct investment has flowed in, making Serbia the leading investment destination in the Western Balkans. Vučić has aggressively courted investors by offering subsidies and keeping wages low – a strategy critics call “social dumping,” but one that has led to a flurry of factory openings. Nearly every week, state media show Vučić proudly opening a new plant or business park, from Chinese-funded tire factories to German automotive parts plants. Government propaganda trumpets <strong data-start="6365" data-end="6406">record GDP growth and rising salaries</strong>, painting a rosy picture of a country finally on the rise after years of hardship. <em data-start="6490" data-end="6534">“We have growth rates that Europe envies,”</em> Vučić often boasts.

							Yet for all these <strong data-start="9056" data-end="9138">glowing comparisons to Tito and claims of being the best government in decades</strong>, there is a dark underbelly to Vučić’s reign that raises doubts about the long-term costs. Indeed, to many liberal democrats and independent observers, Serbia under Vučić looks less like a success story and more like a cautionary tale – <strong data-start="9376" data-end="9417">“a test case for democratic resolve,”</strong> as one analyst put it<span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/online-exclusive/why-aspiring-autocrats-are-watching-serbia/#:~:text=Image" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">journalofdemocracy.org</span></span></span></a></span>. Behind the shiny new highways and foreign investments lies a systematic erosion of democratic institutions unprecedented in Serbia’s post-2000 history.

							The <strong data-start="13538" data-end="13576">human cost of this autocratization</strong> is hard to ignore. Belgrade’s streets in recent years have filled periodically with tens of thousands of protesters – students, opposition supporters, even apolitical parents pushed to the edge by events like two mass shootings in 2023. These citizens march under slogans like “Serbia against violence,” demanding an end to propaganda and abuse of power. They are met with Vučić’s characteristic defiance: he alternates between dismissing protesters as “anti-Serb” troublemakers, and feigning sympathy by offering cosmetic concessions. So far, the regime’s resilience has been notable. The opposition remains fragmented and hamstrung by the <strong data-start="14218" data-end="14239">unfair conditions</strong>. As one German commentator observed in late 2023, <em data-start="14290" data-end="14512">“the last elections were neither free nor fair.

Under such conditions, defeating Vučić at the ballot box is a herculean task. And so, <strong data-start="14678" data-end="14717">Vučić stands virtually unchallenged</strong>, extending his dominance into its second decade.
						</p>
						<p data-start="14769" data-end="15922">
							This reality begs the question: <em data-start="14801" data-end="14958">Even if Vučić’s government has delivered economic growth and stability, can it truly be called the “best” since Tito if it comes at the price of democracy?</em> To some liberal democrats, especially those who fought against Milošević’s dictatorship in the 1990s, the current regime’s authoritarian bent is a bitter betrayal of the democratic promise after 2000. Freedom House now rates Serbia only “Partly Free,” noting that the SNS has <strong data-start="15235" data-end="15354">“steadily eroded political rights and civil liberties, pressuring independent media, opposition, and civil society”</strong><span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/serbia/freedom-world/2024#:~:text=Serbia%20is%20a%20parliamentary%20democracy,opposition%2C%20and%20civil%20society%20organizations" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">freedomhouse.org</span></span></span></a></span>. The respected V-Dem Institute bluntly classifies Serbia as <strong data-start="15454" data-end="15490">“electoral autocracy since 2014”</strong>, meaning Vučić’s entire tenure falls outside the realm of true democracy<span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00027162251316346?download=true#:~:text=Democratic%20Backsliding%20Through%20Legislative%20Capture,an%20electoral%20autocracy%20since%202014" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">journals.sagepub.com</span></span></span></a></span>. By those metrics, one could argue <strong data-start="15638" data-end="15693">Vučić’s is actually the worst government since Tito</strong> in terms of pluralism and freedom – even Milošević’s open dictatorship in the 1990s eventually gave way to a democratic revolution, whereas Vučić’s hybrid system insidiously maintains a democratic façade while hollowing it out.
						</p>
						<p data-start="15924" data-end="17781">
							And yet, the uncomfortable reality is that <strong data-start="15967" data-end="16085">many Serbians, perhaps even many self-professed democrats, continue to support Vučić or at least tolerate his rule</strong> because they see no better alternative. It is here that one must grapple with the <strong data-start="16168" data-end="16203">nuanced perspectives in between</strong> the pro- and anti-Vučić extremes. Serbia’s educated urban liberals may decry Vučić’s authoritarianism, but a large portion of the population – including some who value democracy in principle – have made a kind of pragmatic peace with the situation. They ask: <em data-start="16463" data-end="16489">What is the alternative?</em> The opposition that ruled in the 2000s had its chance and became mired in corruption and infighting; today’s opposition parties are divided, ideologically disparate, and often seen as impotent. On the other hand, if Vučić fell, there’s a risk that <strong data-start="16738" data-end="16786">ultranationalists even more extreme than him</strong> (the very “bogeymen” he has cleverly kept at the margins) might surge into the vacuum. Vučić himself plays on this fear masterfully. He has <strong data-start="16927" data-end="16974">amplified fringe far-right figures in media</strong> – much as Milošević once propped up Vojislav Šešelj’s Radicals as a scarecrow – to signal to the West and moderate voters that the alternative to his rule could be outright fascists or chaos<span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://nuso.org/articulo/serbia-una-rebelion-popular-a-contracorriente/#:~:text=La%20receta%20se%20remonta%20a,durante%20la%20Guerra%20de%20Kosovo" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">nuso.org</span></span></span></a></span>. It’s a classic tactic: present yourself as the lesser evil, the only bulwark against the return of ugly nationalism. Vučić learned from the best in this regard; as a young politician in the 1990s he literally <em data-start="17415" data-end="17420">was</em> one of those ultranationalist shock troops, and he knows how the game is played<span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://nuso.org/articulo/serbia-una-rebelion-popular-a-contracorriente/#:~:text=Partido%20Radical%20Serbio%20,durante%20la%20Guerra%20de%20Kosovo" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">nuso.org</span></span></span></a></span>. By rebranding himself and forming the SNS as a “progressive” conservative party, he made himself palatable to both Western diplomats and Serbian centrists – co-opting the pro-European rhetoric while quietly retaining many illiberal habits.

							The <strong data-start="17787" data-end="17825">trade-off many Serbs have accepted</strong> can be summed up in a telling statistic from a 2015 survey: when asked to choose, <strong data-start="17908" data-end="18014">83% of Serbians said they would prefer a <em data-start="17951" data-end="17971">prosperous economy</em> over a <em data-start="17979" data-end="18012">democratic system of government</em></strong><span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://www.iri.org/resources/iri-serbia-poll-98-see-corruption-as-serious-problem-concerned-about-economy-majority-say-economic-prosperity-more-important-than-democracy/#:~:text=Asked%20which%20would%20be%20more,who%20would%20democratically%20distribute%20power" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">iri.org</span></span></span></a></span>.

These numbers speak volumes. After the tumult of the post-socialist transition, a majority are essentially saying: <em data-start="18343" data-end="18407">Give us stability and growth, even if it means less democracy.</em> Vučić’s rule is the embodiment of that bargain. To his supporters, <strong data-start="18475" data-end="18539">the gains under Vučić are tangible and therefore “worth it.”</strong> They point to new jobs, higher pensions and public sector salaries, shiny bridges over the Danube, gleaming Chinese-built factories, and the simple fact that life feels safer and more predictable than in the wild 90s or the lean 2000s. <em data-start="18776" data-end="18864">“We have peace, we have vaccines, we have highways – what did democracy ever give us?”</em> said one elderly gentleman on the streets of Belgrade during a pro-government rally, cutting to the chase of the populist appeal. It’s an attitude not unlike that found in some other Eastern European countries where illiberal leaders have taken hold: democracy is nice, but <strong data-start="19139" data-end="19190">bread on the table and national pride are nicer</strong>.
						</p>
						<p data-start="19194" data-end="20568">
							From this vantage point, one can understand why even some otherwise liberal-minded Serbs might grudgingly rank Vučić’s regime as the “best since Tito.” The <strong data-start="19350" data-end="19404">alternatives on offer have not inspired confidence</strong>. Milošević’s era is widely reviled; the early democratic era is remembered as economically miserable; Tadić’s presidency, though more open, ended amid disappointment and allegations that his party was itself monopolizing power. Vučić, for all his flaws, has projected vigor and direction. He implemented (with an IMF accord) a period of austerity and fiscal reform around 2014–2015 that stabilized public finances – painful medicine that previous governments hesitated to swallow. He has improved government efficiency in delivering services, if only to boost his own popularity. And unlike most Serbian politicians, Vučić is constantly visible – holding marathon press conferences, fielding citizens’ questions on live TV, sometimes even <strong data-start="20144" data-end="20201">responding to critics on Twitter in the dead of night</strong>. This hyper-presidential style reinforces the sense that <em data-start="20259" data-end="20268">someone</em> is at the helm. In Serbia’s heavily paternalistic political culture, that counts for a lot. The ghost of Tito – the grandfatherly figure who watched over Yugoslavia – lurks in the background, and Vučić is unabashed about positioning himself as a modern-day <em data-start="20526" data-end="20532">vožd</em> (a folk term for a strong leader).
						</p>
						<p data-start="20570" data-end="22337">
							Of course, there are many who find this state of affairs deeply troubling. Serbia’s small but vocal community of liberal democrats, independent journalists, and human rights activists warn that <strong data-start="20764" data-end="20821">Vučić’s “stable Serbia” is a powder keg in the making</strong>. They argue that the <strong data-start="20843" data-end="20914">institutions hollowed out today will be desperately needed tomorrow</strong>, whether to fight corruption, ensure justice, or weather the next crisis. They fear that <strong data-start="21004" data-end="21034">brain drain and emigration</strong>, already high, will only accelerate as young educated Serbs give up on a country where merit is less important than party loyalty. (Indeed, a cruel paradox of Vučić’s economic “success” is that unemployment dropped partly because <strong data-start="21265" data-end="21331">hundreds of thousands of young Serbians simply left for the EU</strong> in search of better opportunities and freedoms, a trend the government prefers not to discuss.) Critics also note that the much-vaunted foreign investments often come at a steep price: generous state subsidies, exploitation of labor, and environmental damage. Chinese factories and mines have been linked to pollution and worker strikes; a controversial planned lithium mine had to be scrapped after massive protests by environmental groups. Meanwhile, <strong data-start="21785" data-end="21812">corruption remains rife</strong> – it’s just that now the corruption is centralized under the ruling party, rather than the free-for-all of the 2000s. Serbia still languishes in the lower ranks of Europe’s corruption indices, and <strong data-start="22010" data-end="22153">public frustration with graft remains sky-high (98% of citizens see corruption as a serious problem)<span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://www.iri.org/resources/iri-serbia-poll-98-see-corruption-as-serious-problem-concerned-about-economy-majority-say-economic-prosperity-more-important-than-democracy/#:~:text=direction%20of%20their%20country%2C%20particularly,is%20more%20important%20than%20democracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">iri.org</span></span></span></a></span></strong>. Vučić periodically announces anti-corruption crackdowns or the arrest of a narcotics gang, but skeptics say these are publicity stunts or factional score-settling within the regime.
						</p>
						<p data-start="22339" data-end="23837">
							So, <strong data-start="22343" data-end="22409">has Vučić’s regime been the best government since Tito’s time?</strong> The answer, fittingly, is not a simple yes or no. It <strong data-start="22463" data-end="22513">depends on what one values, and what one fears</strong>. If the yardsticks are <em data-start="22537" data-end="22598">stability, economic development, and international standing</em>, Vučić can make a strong case for himself. Serbia in 2024 is undeniably more stable and globally integrated than Serbia in 1999 under Milošević; it is more prosperous than Serbia in 2009 under the Democratic Party; and it hasn’t fragmented or descended into chaos like some predicted when nationalist forces regained power. Vučić has adroitly balanced relations with big powers, pursuing what one observer called a “multi-vector” foreign policy reminiscent of Yugoslavia’s nonaligned diplomacy<span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://en.interaffairs.ru/article/vucic-in-serbia-more-popular-than-tito/#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20pandemic%20is%20not,by%20the%20then%20head%20of" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">en.interaffairs.ru</span></span></span></a></span>. Under him, Serbia has hosted everything from Chinese investment summits to a Russian arms showcase to an <strong data-start="23238" data-end="23271">EU-Western Balkans conference</strong> – trying to be friend to all, enemy to none. He has avoided the drastic mistakes of his predecessors: no reckless wars, no hyperinflation, no complete diplomatic isolation, no state collapse. It’s a <em data-start="23471" data-end="23480">low bar</em>, some would note, but given Serbia’s recent history, not plunging the country into disaster is an achievement in itself. And Vučić has arguably gone beyond mere survival: his Serbia has an air of ambition, casting itself as a leader in the Balkan region and a connector between East and West. These are things many Serbs take pride in, even if grudgingly.
						</p>
						<p data-start="23839" data-end="25323">
							However, if the yardsticks are <em data-start="23870" data-end="23928">democratic quality, institutional integrity, and freedom</em>, then Vučić’s regime is deeply lacking – possibly the most deficient since the one-party days of Yugoslavia. The <strong data-start="24042" data-end="24145">democratic backsliding under Vučić is not a side issue; it’s central to how his government operates</strong>. Serbia’s constitution (drafted in 2006) envisioned a European-style parliamentary democracy with checks and balances. Today, that system is a facade. Parliament has been reduced to a rubber stamp for the government, and Vučić often bypasses even his own ministers when making decisions, preferring to announce major policies personally on television. Dissenting voices in media or academia are marginalized or silenced. This erosion of democracy has <em data-start="24597" data-end="24621">long-term consequences</em>. One might ask: what happens when Vučić inevitably leaves the scene? Will Serbia be left with hollowed institutions incapable of a smooth transfer of power? Will the next leader continue in the autocratic mold, since that’s the new norm? These questions haunt Serbian liberals. Some warn that <strong data-start="24915" data-end="25042">the longer Vučić stays and entrenches his personalized rule, the harder it will be to rebuild a liberal democracy afterward</strong> – a pattern seen in countries like Hungary or Turkey, which also started as hybrid regimes and slid further. Vučić’s critics therefore argue that even if his rule brought short-term gains, the <em data-start="25236" data-end="25254">long-term damage</em> to Serbian society’s democratic fabric may outweigh those benefits.
						</p>
						<p data-start="25325" data-end="26506">
							Interestingly, even among Vučić’s detractors there is nuance. A few acknowledge that his reign has at least <strong data-start="25433" data-end="25462">brought a degree of order</strong>. <em data-start="25464" data-end="25561">“We needed a shock to the system after the corruption of the 2000s, but now it’s gone too far,”</em> confided one opposition politician, suggesting that Vučić’s early reforms might have done some good before power absolutism set in. Others concede that Vučić’s tough stance on certain issues – for example, <em data-start="25768" data-end="25833">refusing to recognize Kosovo’s independence without concessions</em>, or <em data-start="25838" data-end="25888">standing up to pressure over sanctions on Russia</em> – resonates with patriotic sentiments that previous governments handled clumsily. In their view, <strong data-start="25986" data-end="26062">Vučić addresses national pride in a way that liberal democrats failed to</strong>, and that matters for winning hearts in Serbia. This suggests a possible middle path some wish for: a government that could keep Vučić’s economic and diplomatic pragmatism <strong data-start="26235" data-end="26246">without</strong> the authoritarianism. The tragedy, they say, is that <strong data-start="26300" data-end="26391">Vučić himself likely believes only an authoritarian style can govern Serbia effectively</strong>, and he’s made it a self-fulfilling prophecy by undermining the very institutions that would allow anything else.
						</p>
						<p data-start="26508" data-end="27759">
							In the final analysis, <strong data-start="26531" data-end="26584">Aleksandar Vučić’s regime is a study in contrasts</strong> – a time of both renewed hope for some and deepening despair for others. It has undeniably outperformed the nightmare years of the 1990s, and in many concrete measures (GDP, foreign investment, infrastructure, stability) it <strong data-start="26809" data-end="26879">surpasses the achievements of Serbia’s more democratic governments</strong> in the 2000s. This is the kernel of truth that Vučić’s supporters latch onto when crowning him the best leader since Tito. But the <em data-start="27011" data-end="27019">method</em> of those achievements – centralized power, curtailed freedoms, a democracy on life support – make others shudder. Serbia today might be <em data-start="27156" data-end="27179">better off materially</em> than it was ten or twenty years ago, but it is also <strong data-start="27232" data-end="27261">less free and pluralistic</strong> than it was a decade ago. Vučić’s Serbia is a place where you can drive on a new highway from Belgrade to Niš, but you’ll mostly hear one voice on the radio as you go; where investors are welcome, but independent journalists are harassed; where elections happen regularly, but the outcome is almost predetermined. It is, in short, a classic <strong data-start="27603" data-end="27639">competitive authoritarian regime</strong> – a system that <strong data-start="27656" data-end="27718">“keeps the forms of democracy while gutting the substance”</strong><span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/online-exclusive/why-aspiring-autocrats-are-watching-serbia/#:~:text=F%20ree%20but%20not%20fair,all%20while%20the%20supposed%20oversight" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">journalofdemocracy.org</span></span></span></a></span>.

Faced with the “possible or likely alternatives” – be it a return to chaotic coalition politics or empowerment of hardline nationalists – they choose Vučić’s hybrid model as the lesser evil. Even a number of Western policymakers have quietly made the same bargain, tolerating Vučić’s excesses in exchange for regional stability<span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://www.srf.ch/news/international/spannungen-auf-dem-balkan-korrupt-autoritaer-machtgierig-die-starken-maenner-im-suedosten#:~:text=Wohl%20darum%20schaut%20die%20EU,in%20den%20grossen%20St%C3%A4dten%20statt" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">srf.ch</span></span></span></a></span>. Others, however, passionately disagree, believing that Serbia should not have to choose between prosperity and democracy – <strong data-start="28332" data-end="28352">it deserves both</strong>, and accepting Vučić’s bargain only delays an inevitable reckoning. They argue that whatever economic progress Serbia has made under Vučić could have been achieved by a cleaner, more democratic government as well, perhaps even more durably. After all, countries like Croatia and Romania also saw growth in the past decade while remaining democratic (if imperfectly so). The difference, they contend, is leadership and political will, not an inherent need for autocracy.

						<p data-start="28825" data-end="29923">
							As this debate rages, <strong data-start="28847" data-end="28901">Vučić himself shows no signs of loosening his grip</strong>. In early 2024, with protests simmering, he mused about possibly stepping down as SNS party leader or calling new elections – gambits that often turned out to be tactics to diffuse opposition momentum. Few believe he will relinquish real power voluntarily. Like Tito in his later years, Vučić has built a personality cult of indispensability: many Serbs simply cannot imagine who, if not Vučić, could run the country. That in itself is a testament to his success – and a warning sign. Tito’s passing in 1980 left Yugoslavia without a strong institutional footing, and within a decade the country unraveled. <strong data-start="29509" data-end="29606">Vučić’s reign, if it continues on its current path, risks a similar hollowing of institutions</strong>, potentially storing up instability for the future. Competitive authoritarian regimes often seem stable – until they aren’t. The true test of whether Vučić’s era was “worth it” may only come when Serbia faces a crisis that requires robust institutions and social trust, commodities arguably weakened under his rule.

							For now, Serbia lives in a gray zone between democracy and autocracy, between the idealized past of Tito and an uncertain future beyond Vučić. His government’s supporters and critics will likely never agree on a simple verdict. Perhaps the judgment of one Belgrader interviewed by a regional newspaper best captures the ambivalence: <em data-start="30258" data-end="30304">“Vučić nije Tito, al’ bolje nam je nego pre”</em> – “Vučić is not Tito, but we’re better off than before.”<span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://www.danas.rs/vesti/politika/vucic-odmah-iza-tita-djindjic-ispred-milosevica/#:~:text=Kad%20dobiju%20%C5%A1est%20ponu%C4%91enih%20imena,tik%20iza%20njega%20Aleksandar%20Vu%C4%8Di%C4%87" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">danas.rs</span></span></span></a></span><span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://www.danas.rs/vesti/politika/vucic-odmah-iza-tita-djindjic-ispred-milosevica/#:~:text=se%20izja%C5%A1njava%2032%20odsto%20ispitanika%2C,ispitanika%2C%2028%20prema%2025%20odsto" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">danas.rs</span></span></span></a></span> In that bittersweet concession lies both the appeal of Vučić’s rule and its fundamental limitation. Serbia has gained a competent, if domineering, captain – but at the expense of the vibrant democracy many once hoped for. Whether that trade was wise will continue to be debated in Serbia’s cafés, parliament, and streets for years to come. And history’s verdict will hinge on what comes after: if Vučić’s strongman governance evolves into something more democratic and sustainable, many may look back on this period as a rough but necessary road to stability. If, however, it entrenches a new era of authoritarianism or leads to a crisis, the judgment may be far harsher. In the meantime, Serbians carry on under their paradoxical president, their hopes and fears encapsulated in the question that headlines so many political discussions nowadays: <strong data-start="31288" data-end="31319">Is this the best we can do?</strong>
