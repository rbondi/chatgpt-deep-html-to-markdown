1. Put your input HTML file into inputs/.
2. Run convert.sh with two arguments: the file in inputs, and what your want the converted markdown file named (without the .md prefix)
3. When done, the converted file is in outputs/ with the prefix `out-`.

You may have to clean up stray DIVs in the output.
