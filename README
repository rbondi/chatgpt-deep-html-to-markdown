# chatgpt-deep-html-to-markdown

A simple HTML-to-Markdown pipeline using Pandoc and Lua filters, designed for cleaning up machine-generated HTML and producing cleaner, footnoted Markdown.

TODO: Add instructions about how to grab the HTML using Chrome after a deep research.

## ðŸš€ Setup (First Time Only)

To create a fresh virtual environment and install all dependencies:

```
make setup
```

This will:
- Create a Python virtual environment in `venv/`
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Create the required `inputs/` and `outputs/` directories
- Preserve those directories in Git (via `.gitkeep` files)

## ðŸ›  Usage

1. Put your input HTML file into `inputs/`.
2. Run `convert.sh` with two arguments:  
   - the filename in `inputs/`  
   - the desired output name (without `.md`)

   Example:
   ```
   ./convert.sh myfile.html converted-name
   ```

3. When done, the converted file will be in `outputs/` with the prefix `out-`, e.g., `outputs/out-converted-name.md`.

You may have to clean up stray `<div>` elements in the output manually.

## ðŸ§¹ Maintenance

- To regenerate the dependency list:

  ```
  make freeze
  ```

- To delete the environment and temporary files:

  ```
  make clean
  ```
